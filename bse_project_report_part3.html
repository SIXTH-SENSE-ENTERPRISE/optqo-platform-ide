\n    <div class="section">\n        <h2>Key Functionalities</h2>\n\n        <h3>1. Data Deduplication and Standardization</h3>\n        <p>\n            A significant portion of the codebase is dedicated to data standardization and deduplication. This includes:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Name Standardization</strong> - Using SAS Data Quality functions to standardize individual and organization names</li>\n            <li><strong>Address Standardization</strong> - Processing address fields to create consistent formats</li>\n            <li><strong>PAN Number Validation</strong> - Validating and standardizing PAN (Permanent Account Number) fields</li>\n            <li><strong>Match Code Generation</strong> - Creating match codes for names and addresses at different confidence levels (75%, 85%)</li>\n            <li><strong>Cluster ID Assignment</strong> - Grouping similar records based on match codes</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>2. Insider Trading Detection</h3>\n        <p>\n            The system implements sophisticated algorithms to detect potential insider trading patterns around company announcements:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Announcement Analysis</strong> - Scanning company announcements for significant events like mergers, dividends, rights issues</li>\n            <li><strong>Trading Pattern Analysis</strong> - Analyzing buying and selling patterns before and after announcements</li>\n            <li><strong>Statistical Modeling</strong> - Using scoring models to identify suspicious trading activity</li>\n            <li><strong>Transaction Profiling</strong> - Examining transaction sizes, timing, and price variations</li>\n            <li><strong>Profit Calculation</strong> - Calculating actual and notional profits from potentially suspicious trades</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            The insider trading detection algorithm pays special attention to:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Trading volume relative to market volume</li>\n            <li>Timing of trades relative to announcements</li>\n            <li>Holding patterns (long vs. short positions)</li>\n            <li>Buy/sell ratios before and after announcements</li>\n            <li>Profit realization patterns</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>3. Reporting and Output Generation</h3>\n        <p>\n            The system generates various reports to support analysis:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Announcement Reports</strong> - Details of company announcements with classification</li>\n            <li><strong>Summary Reports</strong> - Suspicious trading activity summaries</li>\n            <li><strong>Transaction Reports</strong> - Detailed transaction logs for suspicious accounts</li>\n            <li><strong>Market Behavior Reports</strong> - Analysis of trading patterns across the market</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            Reports are exported to Excel format with multiple sheets for different views of the data.\n        </p>\n    </div>
